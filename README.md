Challenge for Applaudo

This is the version I could done so far within the time Applaudo told me to work on it. 
It has been kind of fun while developing it and I have learned some things in advance.

Mayor achievements were:
Listing series from anilist server
Understanding of the anilist API in order to implement query browsing
Implementing some third party software using cocoaPods
Using YouTube VidePlayer when youtube id is available
Implementing "ala" netflix view for the main screen, using several collection views inside a table view
Using a tab bar controller to switch between normal view or search view
Assigning traits for using the details screen on portrait and landscape and making UIControls being displayed correctly
Implementing Reachability in order to know if there is internet connection or nor (only an image was updated if so)
Programming the manga retrieval information as same as anime
Using KingFisher to manage image from url requests
Using SwiftyJSON to process JSON objects from web requests
